This is the implementation of Geometric flow regularization in latent spaces with the efficient variations of curvature.

Please feel free to try out this code. If you have immediate comments or spot notable errors, please feel free to reach out.

Unfortunately, I am not able to attach my saved Navier-Stokes parameters or datasets because the files are too large. The parameters I used to collect results in the other 4 experiments are attached.

My data sources were as follows:

Burger's equation: https://github.com/sachabinder/Burgers_equation_simulation/tree/main  
Navier-Stokes: https://github.com/crewsdw/Incompressible2D
